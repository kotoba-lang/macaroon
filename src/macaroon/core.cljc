  "Macaroons: a bearer token you can narrow without asking anyone.

  The whole construction is one idea. The token carries a chained MAC —

      sig₀ = HMAC(root-key, identifier)
      sigₙ = HMAC(sigₙ₋₁, caveatₙ)

  — so **anyone holding the token can append a caveat and recompute the
  chain, and nobody can remove one**, because removing a caveat means
  inverting an HMAC. Attenuation needs no key, no round trip and no
  registrar; only the mint and the verify need the root key.

  That is the property this library exists for, and it is the one the tests
  are about. Everything else here is bookkeeping.

  ## What a macaroon is *not*

  **It is a bearer token.** Whoever holds it can use it, and can hand it to
  anyone. There is no holder key, so possession is authority — which is why
  `:holder` caveats exist and why binding one to a principal is a caveat
  rather than a property of the format. `org-biscuitsec` is the same idea
  with public-key attenuation instead, and the two are in this workspace for
  exactly that contrast.

  **It does not decide anything.** Verification answers *is this token
  intact, and are its caveats met*. What the resulting authority covers is
  `authority`'s question, and `macaroon.authority` is the one-way door
  between them. A verified macaroon is inert evidence (root ADR-2608159400),
  not a capability.

  ## Crypto is injected, all of it

  `hmac-fn` is `(fn [key data] bytes)`. There is no default, for the reason
  `blind`'s README gives: a storage or token layer that owns keys is a layer
  that has to be trusted with them. `seal-fn` / `unseal-fn` are only needed
  for third-party caveats.

  ## Wire format

  `serialize` emits canonical EDN. **Byte compatibility with libmacaroons v1
  or v2 is not implemented and not claimed** — no external implementation has
  read anything this produces, and until one has, saying \"macaroon format\"
  would be the kind of claim `org-apache-parquet` learned to distrust from
  inside its own test suite."
